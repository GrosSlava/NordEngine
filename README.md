# Nord Engine

Welcome to the **Nord Engine** source code!

With the code in this repository, you can build the **Nord Engine** for your platform.
Modify the code in any way you can imagine, and share your changes with others!



## Supported platforms

## Requirements

## State of Development

We publish source for the engine in several branches:

- `Numbered branches` identify past and upcoming official releases.
- The `main branch` is the hub of changes from all our engine development teams. Itâ€™s not subject to as much testing as release branches.
- Branches whose names contain `dev`, `staging`, and `test` are typically for internal processes, and are rarely useful for end users.

Other short-lived branches may pop-up from time to time as we stabilize new releases or hotfixes.
